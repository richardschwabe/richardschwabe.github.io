On the 4rd of December I reached 1k subscribers on Youtube. I'd like to thank everyone for subscribing.

I am still finding my style and am my biggest critique. I like teaching. I always have. It is a lot of fun, but also heart breaking to see that my videos are not so good.

I have gained a lot of valuable knowledge and would love to share it.

Unfortunately, I have not figured out how to present this knowledge in a good way.

I don't care about the youtube algorithm and I thing that should be clear from my videos.
At the moment they would be considered "search based videos" - or whatever it is, videos that aren't recommended and therefore don't go viral, but videos you can find via Google searches.

However, I do need to find a style and I need to try out a lot of things. I'm approaching the entire thing like I approach programming.

Watching isn't enough. You must try it, change it, run into errors and fix it. Learning how to programm happens by programming and not by reading. It helps, but the best
is to have your own project in which you constantly ask yourself "How can I do ....", the passion and curiosity will get you there. The journey to get good at something
is what matters. Otherwise how would one judge "best practices" ? You cannot understand best practices, if you haven't done it the wrong way beforehand.

Anyways, I am setting up this casual blog in which I want to document some of the videos and give extra information that I think don't belong in the comment section and neither
in a discord chat.

So, thank you everyone for sticking around! I hope to see you in the next video.
